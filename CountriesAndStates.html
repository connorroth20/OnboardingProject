<!-- What I want to do now
1. I want to add a select button (like to the two dots) that will ask the user if they want to choose a new country or current
this will allow for more accesibility and choices for them
2. I want to color it, make it blue and green like the earth so it is appealing 
3. I also want to include a picture in there 
4. Maybe, just for fun, include a picture or link that gives more information about selected country?? This could be a challenge but also very fun
5. Embed a gif
6. make it scrollable/look good
7. have different sections

For myself: 
Create a stock trading app or device that will manage my investments and give me recommendations for the future.-->
